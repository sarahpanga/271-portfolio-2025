Lab 1 - User Story Mapping
By Sarah Panga

My storyboard has:
- 3 epics in backbone
- 9 steps in walking skeleton
- 28 total tasks w/ name, status and time estimate
- 3 detailed tasks w/ 3 different features tried
- 2 releases and unscheduled tasks
- 1 extra feature

General thought process for developing the story map:
I had three main goals in my story map: the first one being the "Get groceries delivered" which is the goal of th user, the second being "Sell to customers" which is the store's main goal and the last one being "Delivery" which is the goal of the delivery person.

- The first epic = This includes the steps that the user has to perform to successfully from creating an account to picking the products they want to buy to checkout with payment information.
- The second epic = This includes the steps that the store has to take to allow the user to be able to perform the tasks. It starts with the log in page for the customers to enter their information, then products and their pictures are added, which are also updated and also pay the admin for the services provided.
- The third epic = This includes the delivery part where again personal information is entered for the account setup for the delivery person, so that they can check the available orders and browse through them to select which one to accept and deliver. They also need to give their bank info in order to be paid for the delivery.

3 decisions:
1. I made the decision to include the delivery dropoff method in the unscheduled tasks because personally as a user that is an option that I always see and am glad 
  that I get to choose. This comes under the checkout section step under getting groceries delivered.
2. I also decided to focus on three main goals: the user, the store, and the delivery person. These can be seen in the storyboard in the same order. It helped me 
   to categorize the different tasks and focus easily by separating the different people of interest
3. In each epic, the first step is account setup. I think it is important for all the three epics, the user, the store and the delivery person to each have their 
   on interface to log in and see the required interface needed.

The extra feature that I tried was the personnas feature. For the first epic I have the user personna since it is the main goal of the user. The second epic has me as a persona as the store.
